connect Rmd SQL chunk to SQLite database

```{r}
library(DBI)
# this line connects to a database, saving a reference to the database as the variable "db"
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "survey.db")
```

## 1. [Selecting Data](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/01-select/index.html)

```{bash}
echo '.tables' | sqlite3 survey.db
```
```{sql connection=db}
SELECT name AS tables FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'
```

```{bash}
echo '.schema' | sqlite3 survey.db
```
```{sql connection=db}
SELECT sql AS schema FROM sqlite_master
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT family, personal FROM Person;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SeLeCt FaMiLy, PeRsOnAl FrOm PeRsOn;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT personal, family FROM Person;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT id, id, id FROM Person;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Person;
```

## 2. [Sorting and Removing Duplicates](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/02-sort-dup/index.html)

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT quant FROM Survey;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT quant FROM Survey;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT taken, quant FROM Survey;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Person ORDER BY id;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY id DESC;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT taken, person, quant FROM Survey ORDER BY taken ASC, person DESC;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT quant, person FROM Survey ORDER BY quant ASC;
```

## 3. [Filtering](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/03-filter/index.html)

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE site = 'DR-1';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT id FROM Visited WHERE site = 'DR-1';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE site = 'DR-1' AND dated < '1930-01-01';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE person = 'lake' OR person = 'roe';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE person IN ('lake', 'roe');
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal' AND person = 'lake' OR person = 'roe';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal' AND (person = 'lake' OR person = 'roe');
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE site LIKE 'DR%';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT person, quant FROM Survey WHERE person = 'lake' OR person = 'roe';
```

## 4. [Calculating New Values](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/04-calc/index.html)

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT 1.05 * reading FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'rad';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT taken, round(5 * (reading - 32) / 9, 2) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'temp';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT taken, round(5 * (reading - 32) / 9, 2) as Celsius FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'temp';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT personal || ' ' || family FROM Person;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = 'dyer' UNION SELECT * FROM Person WHERE id = 'roe';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT site FROM Visited;
```

## 5. [Missing Data](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/05-null/index.html)

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated < '1930-01-01';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated >= '1930-01-01';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated = NULL;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated != NULL;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated IS NULL;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated IS NOT NULL;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Visited WHERE dated IN ('1927-02-08', NULL);
```

## 6. [Aggregation](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/06-agg/index.html)

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT dated FROM Visited;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT min(dated) FROM Visited;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT max(dated) FROM Visited;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT avg(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT count(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT sum(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT min(reading), max(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal' AND reading <= 1.0;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT person, count(*) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'sal' AND reading <= 1.0;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT person, max(reading), sum(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'missing';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT min(dated) FROM Visited;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT min(dated) FROM Visited WHERE dated IS NOT NULL;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT person, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
FROM  Survey
WHERE quant = 'rad';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT person, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
FROM  Survey
WHERE quant = 'rad'
AND   person = 'dyer';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT   person, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
FROM     Survey
WHERE    quant = 'rad'
GROUP BY person;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT   person, quant, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
FROM     Survey
GROUP BY person, quant;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT   person, quant, count(reading), round(avg(reading), 2)
FROM     Survey
WHERE    person IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY person, quant
ORDER BY person, quant;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT reading - avg(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'rad';
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT reading - (SELECT avg(reading) FROM Survey WHERE quant = 'rad')
FROM   Survey
WHERE  quant = 'rad'
```

## 7. [Combining Data](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/07-join/index.html)

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Site JOIN Visited;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT * FROM Site JOIN Visited ON Site.name = Visited.site;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT Site.lat, Site.long, Visited.dated
FROM   Site JOIN Visited
ON     Site.name = Visited.site;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT Site.lat, Site.long, Visited.dated, Survey.quant, Survey.reading
FROM   Site JOIN Visited JOIN Survey
ON     Site.name = Visited.site
AND    Visited.id = Survey.taken
AND    Visited.dated IS NOT NULL;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT rowid, * FROM Person;
```

```{sql connection=db}
SELECT Site.name
FROM   Site JOIN Visited
ON     Site.lat <- 49.0
AND    Site.name = Visited.site
AND    Visited.dated >= '1932-01-01';
```

## 11. [Programming with Databases - R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/11-prog-R/index.html)

```{r}
results <- dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT Site.lat, Site.long FROM Site;")
print(results)
```

```{r}
getName <- function(personID) {
  query <- paste0("SELECT personal || ' ' || family FROM Person WHERE id =='",
                  personID, "';")
  return(dbGetQuery(db, query))
}

print(paste("full name for dyer:", getName('dyer')))
```

```{r}
dbListTables(db)
```

```{r}
dbDisconnect(db)
```
