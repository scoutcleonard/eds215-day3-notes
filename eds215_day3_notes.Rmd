### SQL

To run SQL in the command line, run `sqlite3`

To quit SQL, run `.q`. 

**NOTE:** an **alias** in Bash lets you shortcut a command as some personalized command! 

- `--` comments out the code
- verbose language! 
- "structured query language": originally made for ordinary people to communicate with databases
  - has since become a programming language, and lost this definition! 
- always starts with a **VERB**
  - then an **object**, want to want to apply the verb to 
  - then what you're taking the data form
  - then a logical expression 
- *Philosophy* SQL is a symbolic language, whereas R is imperative. You can find things in databases, but you can't assign variables or tell databases to do specific things. 

#### Databases
- *Everything in a database is a table.* You can save items of interest in SQL as a database.
- order of observations doesn't matter
- order of columns/variables doesn't matter
- "relational" databases refers to the fact that the observations are not related to each other, but grouped
