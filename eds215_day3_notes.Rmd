### SQL

To run SQL in the command line, run `sqlite3`

To quit SQL, run `.q`. 

*SQL is a workflow. Rarely do you work with databases in the database.*

**NOTE:** an **alias** in Bash lets you shortcut a command as some personalized command! 

- `--` comments out the code
- verbose language! 
- "structured query language": originally made for ordinary people to communicate with databases
  - has since become a programming language, and lost this definition! 
- always starts with a **VERB**
  - then an **object**, want to want to apply the verb to 
  - then what you're taking the data form
  - then a logical expression 
- *Philosophy* SQL is a symbolic language, whereas R is imperative. You can find things in databases, but you can't assign variables or tell databases to do specific things. 

#### Databases
- *Everything in a database is a table.* You can save items of interest in SQL as a database.
- order of observations doesn't matter
- order of columns/variables doesn't matter
- "relational" databases refers to the fact that the observations are not related to each other, but grouped 
- R doesn't know about what's going on inside databases. When you have a database, it's added to the whole database, but it won't show up in the environment, becuase R only knows about DB. Only SQL knows about the new tables you make. 
- you can open and write into the database through the terminal and through R Studio using SQ Lite 3. 

- **null**: it's legitimate to have an observation with an unknown value. It's treated as a "known unknown." It represents a *possible* value, where we don't know what it is. 

#### Aggregations

Aggregations for on a single column value and *sort out the nulls.* (for example, if taking the mean of 9 rows with one null value, the sum will be divided by 8, not 9, discounting the na value).

- `count()` counts the number of rows returned. 
- if you run `.mode box` you can return table data in actual tables!!
- **Group By** 

#### Combining Data

- Joins match two tables based on matching values in columns.
